# DeathMarkers

**Online death collection**, not only for fun <cy>Mario Maker-style Death Markers</c>,
but also for <cg>in-depth analysis of gameplay</c>.

**Features:**

- Show <cy>other players' deaths</c> when you die
- Analyze player deaths in your levels
- Help creators <cg>improve</c> their levels

**Planned Features:** (who knows if these ever get done lmao)

- Built-in analysis <cg>helper tools</c>
- (minimal) Player path tracing

## Solo Use

If you wish to use the mod to record your death locations to learn your weak points in a level, you can enable the "Show only local deaths" setting. That way, your deaths are also stored locally and markers are only loaded from there.

If you don't need the locally stored markers anymore, you can head to this mod's data directory and delete the file corresponding to the ID of the level you want to clean.

## Disclaimer

The mod makes use of your *username and user ID* to create an identifier for you. <cg>This identifier **can not be traced back to you**</c>; it is unique to you for the purpose of grouping together attempts (/deaths) that were from the same player. Your identifier is *different* for every level you play, so your deaths *cannot* be grouped together across levels.

You can <cr>prevent</c> the mod from sharing your deaths and still show others' deaths in the settings, although it is recommended to <cg>keep (anonymous) sharing on</c> for creators seeking to use the data to improve their levels.

## Special Thanks

**Adam_729** for creating the [first mod of this kind](https://github.com/Adam7290/deathmarkers)! As this is my first mod, a lot of the original source code helped me figure out the process of modding with Geode.
